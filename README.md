# PlantHealthBot-AI-

**An AI-Powered Cable-Driven Robotic System for Plant Health Assessment in Vertical Farming**

## Overview
This project implements a cost-effective, AI-powered cable-driven robotic system for monitoring plant health in vertical farming environments. It features:
- A custom CNN (TensorFlow/Keras) that classifies plant images as healthy or unhealthy.
- An image preprocessing pipeline using OpenCV.
- Real-time video monitoring with automatic email alerts upon detecting unhealthy plants.
- Integration with a motorized pulley and live-streaming camera for autonomous scanning.


## Environment Setup

To recreate the conda environment used for this project, run:
